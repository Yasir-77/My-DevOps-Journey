### What is git?

Git is a distributed version control system that enables users to collaborate on projects, tracking changes in files and directories while providing a history of snapshots and the ability to manage different branches and merge code changes efficiently

### Why is Git essential in modern software development

- Industry standard - It is a fundamental skill and is listed as an essential skill in many tech roles. Git enables developers to work more effieciently and collaborate effectively with their team. Used by many organisations and is wide spread, easy integration. Gits verstaility make it suitable for projects of all sizes and complexities.

- Version control - Git allows developers to track changes made to files over time, keeping a history of all modifications. This makes it easy to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong or to see how the code evolved.
  
- Backup and restore - Git naturally serves as a backup mechanism since every clone of a repository contains the entire project history. If a server crashes, the project can be fully recovered from any developer’s local copy. This prevents accidental data loss and prevents any unintended changes. Allowing the code to revert back to stable state.

- Branching and merging -  Git’s branching model lets developers create isolated branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments. This isolates the work, reducing the risk of bugs or instability in the main codebase. Once the changes are ready, they can be merged into the main project. Allows developers to work on multiple aspects of the same project.
