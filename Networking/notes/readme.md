## Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking fundamentals

### Overview of computer networks

A computer network is a group of devices connected to each other allowing them to share information and resources.

Importance in modern infrastructure:

Foundation - Enables communication between devices

Resource sharing - Facilitates sharing of files, printers and more

Internet functionality - Critical for browsing, streaming and communication 

Application support - Backbone for app connectivity and data transfer

Netowking in Devops

Server Interactions - Enables communication between servers and applications.

Deployment - Critical for mlaunching and updating applications 

Management - Crucial in monitoring and managing infrastructure

Optimisation - Enhances troubleshooting, performance and scalability

### Network basics/Types of Networks

Two core types of networks

1 - LAN (Local area Network) small area, like home or office, connects devices to share resources e.g. Home Wi-Fi, printers any devices in single location 

2 - WAN (Wide Area Network) covers large areas, like a city, country or a larger regions,connects multiple LANs over long distances e.g. Internet

### Key Networking components

Switches - Connect devices within the same network, manage data flow within a LAN

Routers - Direct traffic between networks, connect different networks

Firewalls - Protect networls from unauthorised access, monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic

### IP address & MAC address

IP addressing refers to the system used to assign unique identifiers, known as IP addresses, to devices connected to a computer network, typically the Internet. An IP address acts like a mailing address for a device, allowing data to be routed between different devices over the network.

Two main types of IP adresses:

- IPv4 - Format: 32-bit address written in four groups of decimal numbers (each group representing 8 bits), separated by periods, like 192.168.0.5
- IPv6 - Format: 128-bit address written in eight groups of hexadecimal numbers (each group representing 16 bits), separated by colons, like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

Ip addresses enable devices to identify and communicate with each other on a network, without them devices wouldnt know where to send or recieve data. 

MAC addresses 

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use within a network. a MAC address is permanently assigned to the hardware by the manufacturer and is often referred to as a hardware address or physical address. MAC address help indetify eachother in a Local netowrk. They play an esential role for network communication and security.

A MAC address is a 48-bit address, usually represented as six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons (:) or hyphens (-), like 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.

### Ports and protocols

What are ports? A port is a logical endpoint for communication through which network connections are made. It helps differentiate between different types of traffic on a device. For example, while an IP address helps identify a device on a network, the port helps identify which service or application on that device should receive the data.

What are protocols? A protocol is a set of rules or standards that determine how data is transmitted across a network. Different protocols are used for different types of communication.

Importance of ports and protocols - Ports ensure data gets to the right application on your device while protocols ensure that the data is undertandable and properly formatted.

Two main types of Protocols:
- TCP (Transmission control protocol)
