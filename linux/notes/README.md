# Linux notes

### What is Linux?
Linux is an open source operating system like Windows and macOS but very different.

Why use Linux?

- Linux is known for its flexibility, customisation and security features, which makes it popular in both professional and personal environments.

- Open Source Nature - Linux is open source, which means its source code is freely available to anyone. This allows users to modify, distribute, and even sell modifications to the OS under their own terms. 

- Cost-Effectiveness - Most Linux distributions are free to download and use, which can result in significant cost savings, especially for businesses and developers who need to deploy multiple machines.

- Customizability - Linux is highly customizable. Users can modify everything from the kernel (the core of the operating system) up to the desktop environment, allowing for a tailored experience that meets specific needs or preferences.

- Security -  Linux is considered highly secure compared to many other operating systems. Its permission and user role features, along with a strong community and frequent updates, help keep systems secure from malware and other vulnerabilities.

- Stability and Reliability - Linux systems are known for their stability and reliability. They can run for years without needing a reboot, which is a critical requirement for servers and continuous operation systems.

- Community Support - The Linux community is one of its greatest assets. A large, active community means users often get rapid support and help through forums, blogs, and community-driven projects.


There are many different versions of Linux called distributions some examples include Ubuntu, Fedora and CentOs.

### Why are there different distributions?

- Different distributions cater to differetn needs, which help beginners choose which one fits their requirements.
